    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based
    batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying
    with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably eaten in
    prehistoric societies.</p>
