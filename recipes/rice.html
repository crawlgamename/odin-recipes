    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice) or, much less commonly, O. glaberrima (African rice). As
    a cereal grain, domesticated rice is the most widely consumed staple food for over half of the world's human population,
    particularly in Asia and Africa. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after
    sugarcane and maize.</p>
